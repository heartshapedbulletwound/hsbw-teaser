    We create in fragments, silhouettes and emotions. Our language is visual, sonic, poetic, and sometimes even silent. We create across fashion, film, sound, and the written word because some stories require multiple forms to land where they're meant to.<br><br>
    We speak to the in between across cultures, styles, and identities. We believe in work that scars beautifully, that lingers, and that expresses what cannot be said aloud. That's why our collaborators are innovators: designers, filmmakers, writers, and artists who stretch the boundaries of format until it transforms into something new.<br><br>
    We don't follow the rules of structure; we disrupt them. We construct emotional worlds and experimental narratives that feel as raw as they are intentional. Nothing we create is passive. Everything is designed to stay with you.<br><br>
    This is not a studio. This is not a brand. This is Heart Shaped Bullet Wound, a story you feel before you understand.
